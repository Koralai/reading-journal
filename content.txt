Props to Sabaa Tahir for creating real suspense: I really thought that //SHOW SPOILER: Helene// was going to die in the Third Trial. I'm disappointed, though, that Laia has just been tossed into a dungeon. I thought that her role in this story as an undercover operative would allow her to overcome challenges on her own, but the more common pattern seems to be that she gets trapped or injured and has to be rescued by someone else. Seriously, how many times in this novel has Laia been cut up or beaten within an inch or her life by one of the villains, and then carried to safety by one of the protagonists? The author tosses her around like a rag doll. Not cool.
